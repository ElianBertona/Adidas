# API and WEB Test Autoation using Serenity, Cucumber and Maven.

First steps:
Download and unzip the projects. 
Add the projects to the IDE (I used Eclipse IDE).

Run the tests separately like this:

mvn clean verify

By default, the web tests run with Chrome browser, so you will need this installed.

The reports will be generated in target/site/serenity.
